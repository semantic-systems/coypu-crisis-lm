      "The sea level increased overnight and in some areas , the situation has been adversely affected by the blocking of drainage canals . Most of the victims are homeless pavement dwellers and beggars . Power and communications have been totally disrupted by the cyclone , which swept up from the Bay of Bengal on the evening of Nov 15th with windspeeds of up to 150mph . The Red Cross Society of China ( RCSC ) , sent financial aid to Taipei on the first day of the disaster and opened a nationally advertised bank account for public donations , as well as keeping a 24 - hour nation wide telephone line open for donations . As regards immediate assistance UNHCR has placed an order for some 2,000 lightweight tents along with 5,000 plastic sheets , 5,000 jerry cans , 3,500 kitchen sets and 3 rubhalls from its emergency stockpiles to be delivered to Medan , from where they will be immediately distributed to Nias . Latrine usage is not common in these areas , but the stagnant flood waters make changing habits all the more urgent . Most were cases with respiratory infections ( 42 % ) , followed by malaria ( 21.7 % ) , intestinal worms ( 7.7 % ) and diarrhoea ( 6.3 % ) . The emergency food and other assistance needs for a growing number of persons displaced by war or drought in this region - plus the needs of an increasingly desperate local population - can be projected to increase substantially over the next twelve months . A dozen bodies were extricated and 105 people escaped alive from the building , most in the first hours after the quake . They would also constitute rapid response teams to deal with disease outbreaks and potential epidemics in conjunction with the government . Scientists in Uzbekistan are voicing serious concerns over the ecological and environmental effects of a new artificial lake being created in the eastern part of Turkmenistan near the Uzbek border . A follow-up committee \" was set up and first met in Moroni , the capital on Grande-Comore island , early in March , with a brief to draw up a new constitution for a loose federation and to set up an independent national electoral commission .\n",
